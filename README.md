# SuperBowl

The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League played in early February.

In this notebook, we load, clean, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. 
We visualize the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. 
We use line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. 
And we discover that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.

The dataset used was scraped and polished from Wikipedia.
